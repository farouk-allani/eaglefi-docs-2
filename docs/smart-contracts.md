# EagleFi - Smart Contracts

## Introduction

**Eagle Finance** is a robust and flexible decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol built for the Massa blockchain. It provides a comprehensive suite of smart contracts, written in AssemblyScript, that enable automated liquidity provision, token swapping, and advanced trading functionalities. The protocol is designed to be efficient, secure, and adaptable, supporting both MRC-20 tokens and wrapped native MAS (WMAS).

**Key Features:**

*   **Automated Liquidity Pools:** Facilitates the creation and management of liquidity pools for seamless token trading.
*   **MRC-20 and WMAS Compatibility:** Supports trading of any MRC-20 token, including wrapped native MAS (WMAS).
*   **Efficient Token Swapping:** Enables quick and cost-effective token swaps based on the constant product formula (x\*y=k).
*   **Flash Loans:** Allows users to borrow tokens without upfront collateral, provided they are returned within the same transaction, enabling arbitrage opportunities.
*   **Protocol Fee Management:** Allows for the collection and distribution of protocol fees to stakeholders.
*   **Secure and Auditable:** Built with security best practices and designed for easy auditing.
