### 🦅 General

**What is EagleFi?**  
EagleFi is a **decentralized exchange built by three passionate developers** who refused to let geography define their impact. Swap tokens, launch projects, and trade on Massa’s lightning-fast network, all while supporting a DEX that believes DeFi should belong to *everyone*.  

**Why build on Massa?**  
Massa isn’t just fast (10,000+ TPS fast), it’s one of the most decentralized blockchains in existence. We chose Massa because **decentralization isn’t a buzzword for us, it’s a mission.**

### 💼 Wallets & Security

**Which wallets work with EagleFi?**

- **MassaStation**: The go-to wallet for Massa purists.  
- **MetaMask**: For cross-chain travelers (with [Massa network configured](https://docs.massa.net/docs/build/wallet/metamask-snap)).  
*No shady extensions. No compromises. Your keys, your crypto.*  

**Is EagleFi safe?**  
We treat your funds like our own. All contracts are audited, open-source, and battle-tested. Still paranoid? (Good! You should be.) [Read the code yourself](https://github.com/NaDasai/eagle-finance).

### 🔄 Swaps & Pools

**What’s impermanent loss?**  
It’s the temporary loss you *might* face if token prices in a pool shift. Think of it like turbulence, manageable if you’re prepared. [Learn to navigate it here](/docs/pools.md).  

**What fees does EagleFi charge?**

- **Swaps**: Fees range from 0.01% to 1% (all fees go directly to liquidity providers):
  - 0.01% for very stable pairs
  - 0.05% for stable pairs
  - 0.3% for most MRC-20 pairs (default)
  - 1% for exotic pairs
- **Token Creation/Pools**: Just gas fees. No hidden costs. Ever.  

**Why provide liquidity?**  
Earn fees passively *and* support the tokens you believe in. Plus, you’ll earn our eternal gratitude. 😉
